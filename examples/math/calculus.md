## What is the power rule for differentiation?

If $f(x) = x^n$, then $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.

## What is the integral of $x^n$?

$$
\int x^n\,dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \quad (n \neq -1)
$$

## What is the chain rule?

If $y = f(g(x))$, then:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

## What does the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus state?

If $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
