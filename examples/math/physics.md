## What is Einstein's mass-energy equivalence?

$E = mc^2$, where $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.

## What is Newton's second law of motion?

$F = ma$, where $F$ is force, $m$ is mass, and $a$ is acceleration.

## What is the Schrödinger equation?

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi = \hat{H} \Psi
$$

where $\Psi$ is the wave function and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator.
